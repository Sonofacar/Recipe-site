## Example

The [demo site](https://de-souza.github.io/hugo-flex/) is built from the [hugoBasicExample](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoBasicExample/) repository.

A complete starter template specifically made for this theme is also available at [scivision/hugo-flex-example](https://github.com/scivision/hugo-flex-example/).


## Installation

1. [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

2. [Create a Hugo site](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/).

3. Open a command prompt at the root of the site and download the theme:

```bash
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/de-souza/hugo-flex.git themes/hugo-flex
```

4. Add the theme to the [site configuration](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/). If the site configuration is a file called `hugo.yaml`:

```bash
echo 'theme: hugo-flex' >> hugo.yaml
```


## Updating

## Built-In Shortcodes

### Math Rendering

Mathematical formulas written in LaTeX notation can be rendered to HTML by surrounding them with the `math` shortcode:

```
{{< math >}}
Inline formulas such as $y=ax+b$ are supported, displayed formulas as well:

$$e^{i\pi}+1=0$$
{{< math />}}
```

Using this shortcode bundles the [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) library with the website, to render math on the client side.
As of 2023, it is [not yet possible](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/10044) to render math on the server side with Hugo.

### Netlify Contact Form

A contact form that works with the [Netlify Forms](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/) service can be inserted with the shortcode:

```
{{< contact >}}
```

A custom URL for the success page may be given as a parameter:

```
{{< contact "/success" >}}
```

### SoundCloud Player

A privacy-friendly [SoundCloud player](https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/articles/115003449627) can be inserted with the shortcode:

```
{{< soundcloud 123456789 >}}
```

The parameter is the track ID and can be extracted from the track's [embed code](https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/articles/115003568008).
The player will only load after user input.


## Syntax Highlighting

This theme makes it possible to automatically use an external stylesheet for syntax highlighting. By default, [syntax highlighting in Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/) adds inline styles to the HTML code generated by the highlighter.
This can be problematic if the site has a strict [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).

To use an external style sheet instead of inline styles, switch the options [markup.highlight.noClasses](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/#highlight) and params.noClasses to false in the [site configuration](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/).
The external style sheet is only included on the pages where syntax highlighting is used.

The default syntax highlighting style is called [monokai](https://xyproto.github.io/splash/docs/monokai.html).
To use a different style, generate a style sheet with the [hugo gen chromastyles command](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_gen_chromastyles/) and place it into the site directory at `assets/css/syntax.css`.


## Custom CSS and JS

This theme offers two ways to add custom CSS or JS assets, allowing minor modifications to be applied without needing to create a fork.

### Site-Wide

Custom CSS and JS files can be loaded as part of the base asset linked by every page. To do so, their filenames have to be added to the [site configuration](#configuration):

```yaml
params:
  css:
    - css/foo.css
    - bar.css
  js:
    - js/foo.js
    - bar.js
```

The paths are relative to the [asset directory](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#assetdir).
In this example, the file paths relative to the site root would be: `assets/css/foo.css`, `assets/bar.css`, `assets/js/foo.js`, and `assets/bar.js`.


### Dynamically Embedded

Sometimes, custom CSS or JS is needed only on specific pages. This theme offers a mechanism to load CSS or JS assets through [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/).
The assets are loaded only once per page, even if they are required by several shortcodes in the same page.

To load a CSS or a JS resource on each page where a shortcode is used, the [shortcode template](https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/) has to add the resource to the `css` or the `js` key of the [Scratch variable](https://gohugo.io/functions/scratch/).
For instance, a shortcode template `myshortcode.html` containing the line

```html
{{ resources.Get "myscript.js" | fingerprint | .Page.Scratch.SetInMap "js" "myscript" }}
```

will cause `myscript.js` to be loaded on every page where `myshortcode` is used.

As a real-life example, this is the template for the built-in SoundCloud shortcode:

```html
{{ resources.Get "css/soundcloud.css" | minify | fingerprint | .Page.Scratch.SetInMap "css" "soundcloud" }}
{{ resources.Get "js/soundcloud.js" | minify | fingerprint  | .Page.Scratch.SetInMap "js" "soundcloud" }}
<div class="Soundcloud" data-id="{{ .Get 0 }}"></div>
```
